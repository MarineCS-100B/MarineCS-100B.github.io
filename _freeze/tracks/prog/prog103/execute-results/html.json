By the end of this module, you'll learn how to:\n\n-   Repeat operations using *vectorized* functions and `for` loops\n\n-   Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to make choices based on conditions\n\n## Pre-class preparation\n\nSet up the [PROG103](https://github.com/MarineCS-100B/prog103)[ module](https://github.com/MarineCS-100B/prog103) on your computer (see [Module Setup and Submission](../../../modules.html)). There you'll find the guided notes and exercises to accompany these recorded lectures.\n\n### {{< fa film title=\"A roll of film\" >}} Lectures\n\n#### Conditions in R\n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://vimeo.com/1049903408 >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Making choices with `if`, `else`, and `else if`\n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://vimeo.com/1049903417 >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Repeating yourself with *vectorized* functions\n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://vimeo.com/1049903430 >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Repeating yourself with `for` loops\n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://vimeo.com/1049903438 >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## In-class activity\n\nIn PROG102 you wrote functions to extract temperatures, exposures, and time from the `kefj` dataset. Here, you'll use loops and if-then statements to calculate extreme hot and cold exposure across sites and season.\n\n@traiger2022 defined extreme hot and cold exposure as *air* temperatures ≥25°C and ≤-4°C, respectively. The goal here is to calculate the hours of extreme hot and cold exposure on average per day in each site and season. For example, on average, how many hours of extreme heat did mussels in Aialik experience in summer?\n\n### Review: write a function\n\nYour first task is to review what you learned in PROG102 by writing a function to *encapsulate* a procedure.\n\n**P1** Describe succinctly what the following code does. This should be a high-level, one-sentence description, not a line-by-line breakdown.\n\n::: callout-tip\nRemember the most common sampling interval from PROG101! Each temperature record represents 30 minutes of time.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsite <- \"Nuka_Pass\"\nseason <- \"Late winter\"\nn_cold <- sum(kefj_site == site &\n                kefj_season == season &\n                kefj_temperature <= -4 &\n                kefj_exposure == \"air\")\nn_total <- sum(kefj_site == site &\n                 kefj_season == season)\nhours_cold <- n_cold * 30 / 60\ndays_total <- n_total * 30 / 60 / 24\nhours_cold_per_day <- hours_cold / days_total\nhours_cold_per_day\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**P2** Let's turn that code chunk into a function. What would you call that function? How many parameters should it take and what would you call them?\n\n**P3** Write a function to encapsulate the code chunk above. Check that it contains all five parts of a function.\n\n### Make an extreme choice\n\nThe code chunk above focuses on extreme *cold* exposure, but we would like to use a similar procedure for extreme *heat* exposure. In order, here's what we'll do.\n\n1.  Use an `if else` statement to create a logical vector indicating whether temperatures are extreme.\n2.  Incorporate the new logical vector into our old code chunk to make it more flexible.\n3.  Add a parameter to your function so it can handle extreme heat *or* cold.\n\n**P4** Fill in the code below to create a logical vector indicating extreme temperatures.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nextreme_type <- \"cold\"\nif (??? == \"???\") {\n  is_extreme <- kefj_temperature ??? ???\n} ??? {\n  ???\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**P5** Copy-paste the code from P1 and edit it to incorporate the `is_extreme` vector into the extreme temperature exposure procedure.\n\n**P6** Copy-paste the function you wrote in P3 and edit it to add a parameter that lets you switch between extreme heat and cold exposure.\n\n::: callout-important\nMake sure that when you edit the function you choose readable names for the function, its parameters, and any variables you define in the body!\n:::\n\n### Season to taste\n\nIn the previous section, you used `if then` to make choices. Now, you're going to use `for` loops to repeat an operation over multiple inputs. In order, you'll:\n\n1.  Identify the unique seasons to loop over\n2.  Calculate extreme heat and cold exposure in each season (for a given site)\n3.  Add a *nested* loop to iterate over the unique sites, as well\n\nWhen you're done, you'll use the results of your loops to find the *mildest* season in Alaska.\n\n**P7** What seasons are in the `kefj` dataset? What function would you use to identify them?\n\n**P8** Fill in the blanks below to make a `for` loop that prints the extreme hot and cold exposure across seasons at site Aialik.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nseasons <- ???\nfor (??? in ???) {\n  heat_exposure <- ???(???, ???, \"hot\")\n  cold_exposure <- ???\n  print(paste(\"Aialik\", ???, heat_exposure, cold_exposure))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**P9** Copy-paste your answer to P8 and add a nested `for` loop to iterate across sites as well as seasons.\n\n**P10** Examine your results from P9. You should find two outputs where both extreme heat and cold exposure were 0. What season were they in?\n\n## Recap and next steps\n\nIn this module you learned how to make make decisions and repeat yourself - key skills for writing complex code!\n\nThis completes the essential coding skills you need for this class. Options for next steps are:\n\nINFO101 - learn how data are organized in tables.\n\nPRST101 - learn to summarize data and prepare for probability and statistics.\n\nCOMM101 - learn to visualize data and begin making publication-quality figures (but do INFO101 first).\n\nFill out the [PROG103 reflection](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkluaWkR8Q1icsBGynAcPzNK7ebYABtLs6tNCB9BTLplo9gA/viewform?usp=header) to complete this module.
