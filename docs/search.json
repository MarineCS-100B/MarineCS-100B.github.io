    "text": "Pair programming in practice\nHere’s how we’ll use pair programming this quarter. Keep in mind: this is only for the in-class portion. The pre-class preparation (videos, notes, exercises) should be done individually.\n\nChoose a partner\nEach week you’ll form a pair with another student. There will be a question about who you’re working with on the end-of-week survey.\nHere are some important things to consider in choosing a partner:\n\nFind someone interested in similar modules as you are - you’ll be working on the same tasks together.\nPair programming works best when both partners have relatively similar experience levels with programming. I emphasize relative because no two of you are exactly the same. Slight differences are to be expected! However, a situation where one partner has substantial experience and the other is brand new will probably not work as well.\nI strongly encourage you to change partners every week! That may not always be possible based on module interest and experience level. However, when you can work with someone new please take that opportunity. Your learning will benefit from interacting the diversity of perspectives and experiences in the class.\n\n\n\nStart programming\n\nPut one laptop away. You’re both going to be working at one keyboard in one repository.\nChoose roles. One partner will be the driver and the other will be the navigator.\n\nThe driver’s primary responsibility is to type - you’ll be the one at the keyboard and focused on the in-the-weeds tasks.\nThe navigator’s primary responsibility is to talk - you’ll be guiding the conversation and staying focused on the big picture as the driver types.\nPrimary is emphasized because the line between the roles is fuzzy. The driver should be thinking critically and considering the whole of the problem. The navigator should be watching what the driver types and helping to find typos and other errors.\n\nSwitch roles every 20 minutes.\n\n\n\nSubmit the module\nBecause you’re both working at the same laptop, your repositories won’t match. Both of you should still submit your repositories on GitHub because I want to see both of your pre-class notes and exercises. Whichever partner’s repository contains the in-class part of the module should mention their partner in the issue they open to submit the repo."

The pre-class preparation is important for making sure you and your partner are both ready to collaborate. Give it your full attention.\nBe patient. When you’re new to coding, describing your ideas is really challenging. It’s natural to get frustrated when your partner doesn’t understand what you’re trying to tell them or vice versa. Figuring out how to articulate your ideas is important for learning how to do data science!\nTake breaks. Learning any skill, particularly technical skills, is mentally taxing. Your brain will saturate well before the end of a 75 minute class. Remind each other to get up, walk around, grab a drink of water - anything to unplug and reconnect."

    "text": "In-class activity\n\nExtreme temperatures in an Alaskan intertidal zone\nThe intertidal zone is where the marine and terrestrial biomes meet. Organisms in this habitat must be able to withstand saltwater immersion, air exposure, and the impact of crashing waves. Some intertidal species are particularly important to both human and ecological communities, including bivalve shellfish like oysters, clams, and mussels. Bivalves may experience direct negative impacts from rising ocean temperatures, but they may receive indirect positive impacts from declining predator populations. From 2014-2016, an extreme marine heatwave gripped the North Pacific, popularly called “The Blob”. Around the same time, in 2013-2014, an outbreak of sea star wasting disease decimated sea stars along the North American Pacific coast, dramatically reducing the populations of these important bivalve predators. These two events could potentially push Alaskan mussel populations in opposing directions, which raises the question: have bivalves been winners or losers in a changing climate? Traiger et al. investigated this question using long-term monitoring data collected around the Gulf of Alaska (Traiger et al. 2022). Key to their study was an analysis of extreme air temperature. In this activity, you will replicate that part of their methods. Follow the assignment submission guidelines when you’ve completed this activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe template repository for this module is available at MarineCS-100B/prog101.\n\n\n\n\nGuiding questions\nRead the abstract and sections 2-2.1 of the methods in Traiger et al., then answer the following questions.\n\nWhat does KEFJ stand for?\nHow was temperature monitored?\nWhat’s the difference between absolute temperature and temperature anomaly?\n\n\n\nBegin exploring\nThe temperature and associated data from KEFJ is available in the marinecs100b R package. Use ?kefj to open the help page for these data.\n\nHow many kefj_* vectors are there?\nHow long are they?\nWhat do they represent?\n\nNow it’s time to begin coding! I want you to figure out the most common sampling interval for the temperature readings. First, sketch a plan on a piece of paper. Which vectors will you need to use? How are they related to each other? What operators or functions will you need?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe function table() will help you out here.\n\n\nNow, fill in the blanks below to get the most common sampling interval. Add comments describing what each line of code does.\n\n???_datetime &lt;- kefj_datetime[kefj_site == ???]\n???_interval &lt;- ???_datetime[???:???] - ???_datetime[???:???]\nt???e(???)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is your first time dealing with dates and times in R. It’s going to take you a while to get used to them and you’ll definitely pull some hair out along the way. “Why isn’t this simpler??” you’ll ask. I wish it could be! But unfortunately we humans treat time in super weird ways and it’s next to impossible to represent it simply. Read “UTC is enough for everyone …right?” by Zach Holman for a humorous (if crass) breakdown of how we got into such a tangled situation.\n\n\n\n\nProblem decomposition\nLook how big the kefj_* vectors are. That’s way too big to tackle all at once! It’s always a good idea to break big, intractable problems down into smaller, digestible components. Let’s begin by finding the hottest and coldest air temperature readings in the dataset. When and where did these extremes happen? Use plot_kefj() to visualize the temperature readings for the days containing those readings. Before you start filling in the blanks in the code below, first sketch your plan for answering these questions. Make sure to consider which vectors you’ll need and how they relate to each other! When you start filling in the code below, add comments to each line of code describing what it does.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCheck out which.min() and which.max()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThis code chunk introduces two new things in R.\nas.POSIXct() is a function for creating vectors that R recognizes as dates and times. For example, to create a variable representing noon on January 1, 2025 you could write jan1_2025 &lt;- as.POSIXct(\"2025-01-1 12:00\"). The tz argument specifies the timezone. \"Etc/GMT+8\" is the timezone the kefj data were collected in.\n& represents “and”. It’s how you combine multiple conditions that have to be true. For example, let’s say I have four people of different ages represented by these vectors:\npeople &lt;- c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Carla\", \"Danielle\")\nages &lt;- c(19, 16, 22, 29)\nThen I can find which people are older than 20 and younger than 25 like this:\npeople[ages &gt; 20 & ages &lt; 25]\n\n\n\n# Plot the hottest day\n\nhottest_idx &lt;- ???(kefj_temperature)\nhottest_time &lt;- ???[hottest_idx]\n??? &lt;- kefj_site[???]\nhotday_start &lt;- as.POSIXct(\"???\", tz = \"Etc/GMT+8\")\nhotday_end &lt;- as.POSIXct(\"???\", tz = \"Etc/GMT+8\")\nhotday_idx &lt;- ??? == hottest_site &\n  ??? &gt;= hotday_start &\n  ??? &lt;= hotday_end\nhotday_datetime &lt;- ???[hotday_idx]\nhotday_temperature &lt;- ???\nhotday_exposure &lt;- ???\nplot_kefj(???, ???, ???)\n\n# Repeat for the coldest day\n\nExamine your visualizations. What patterns do you notice in time, temperature, and exposure? Do those patterns match your intuition, or do they differ?\nNow that you’ve visualized the extreme temperatures you’re ready to begin calculating extreme temperature exposure. Re-read section 2.1 of Traiger et al. How did they define extreme heat exposure? Translate their written description to code and calculate the extreme heat exposure for the hottest day. Compare your answer to the visualization you made. Does it look right to you? Repeat this process for extreme cold exposure on the coldest day.\n\n\nPutting it back together (optional)\nYou’ll see more about problem decomposition in PROG103. If you’d like a preview, try the following.\nLet’s go from analyzing a single day to a whole season. Re-read how Traiger et al. quantified extreme hot and cold air temperature exposures at the seasonal scale. Make a sketch of how you would do that for a single site and season.\nPick one site and one season. What were the extreme heat and cold exposure at that site in that season? Repeat for a different site and a different season.\nTraiger et al. also calculated water temperature anomalies. Consider how you could do that. Make a sketch showing which vectors you would need and how you would use them. Write code to get the temperature anomalies for one site in one season in one year."

However, to change the site or date you’d have to copy-paste-edit the entire code. In this activity, you’ll parameterize the extreme heat/cold procedures in functions to make them more readable and reusable.\nThis activity has multiple problems for you to solve, labeled P1, P2, P3, and so on. You’ll find the same labels in prog102.R in your copy of the module.\n\nWriting a utility function\nUtility functions are short functions that encapsulate a common task with a useful name. You’re going to write one for converting text to datetime objects in the Alaskan timezone.\nReview your code from PROG101. How did you extract the temperature and exposure from the hottest day? Copy-paste the code into prog102.R (P1). Make a mental note of the line of code that creates a datetime object (which R calls POSIXct).\nRecall functions have five parts:\n\nThe function’s name\nThe keyword function\nParameters, enclosed in parentheses\nThe function’s body, enclosed in curly braces\nA return for the output\n\nFill in the blanks below to write the Alaskan datetime utility function (P2). Its input should be a text string representing a datetime (e.g., “2020-02-02 16:00”). The output should be a POSIXct object for that datetime in the Alaskan timezone. Make sure you choose names for the function and parameters that make it easy to read! Each set of ‘???’ corresponds to one of the five parts of a function.\n??? &lt;- ???(???) {\n  ???\n  return(???)\n}\nYou’ll use this utility function in the next section, where you’ll write functions for extracting temperatures, exposures, and datetimes.\n\n\nExtracting data\nFirst, we’ll visualize temperature and exposure for two different sites on two different dates by copy-paste-edit.\nMake a copy of your code from P1 and edit it to plot the temperature and exposure for “Aialik” on 2012-06-01 (P3).\nMake a copy of your code from P3 and edit it to plot the temperature and exposure for “Harris” on 2016-04-05 (P4).\nCompare your solutions for P3 and P4 - what variables changed (P5)? The variables that change values for different inputs are what you want to pick for your function’s parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen converting code to a function, the process of changing fixed variables into flexible parameters is called parameterization.\n\n\nYou’re going to convert this code into a function. Remember that functions should make our code easier to read, which means the function and parameters should have descriptive names. What you would pick for the temperature extraction function and parameters’ names (P6)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen parameterizing a function, you’re usually going from a specific case to a more general purpose tool. That’s the whole point of reusable functions! So your parameter names will often be more general versions of the variable names used in the specific case.\n\n\n\n\nWriting extraction functions\nUsing the function and parameter names you picked, write a function (with all five parts!) that extracts the temperature for a given site and date. This is where you’ll use the utility function you wrote above. Fill in the blanks in the code below to write your temperature extraction function (P7).\n??? &lt;- ???(???, ???, ???) {\n  ??? &lt;- your_utility_function_name_here(???)\n  ??? &lt;- your_utility_function_name_here(???)\n  ???\n  return(???)\n}\nNow you’ll do the same for extracting exposure and datetimes. Make a copy of your solution to P7, and edit it to create exposure and datetime extraction functions (P8). As always, remember to choose helpful function names!\nTake a screenshot of the code for your temperature extraction function and annotate the screenshot (e.g. in Powerpoint or Keynote) to label the five parts of your function. Export your annotated version as a JPEG called “annotated_function.jpg” and add it to your copy of the module repository (P9).\nNow let’s test your functions. Extract the temperature, exposure, and datetime for site Nuka_Pass on July 1, 2018 and visualize them (P10). It may help to review as.POSIXct() and plot_kefj() from PROG101. Save a copy of the plot as “nuka_pass_2018-07-01.png” in this repo (P11). There’s an option to export a plot as an image from the Plots pane (see screenshot below).\n\nBy writing the three extraction functions, you’ve encapsulated the logic for extracting data. Compare the code you wrote to create the plot in this module to the code you wrote in PROG101. Qualitatively, how do they compare? Which one is easier to read and why? (P12)"

(2022) defined extreme hot and cold exposure as air temperatures ≥25°C and ≤-4°C, respectively. The goal here is to calculate the hours of extreme hot and cold exposure on average per day in each site and season. For example, on average, how many hours of extreme heat did mussels in Aialik experience in summer?\n\nReview: write a function\nYour first task is to review what you learned in PROG102 by writing a function to encapsulate a procedure.\nP1 Describe succinctly what the following code does. This should be a high-level, one-sentence description, not a line-by-line breakdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRemember the most common sampling interval from PROG101! Each temperature record represents 30 minutes of time.\n\n\n\nsite &lt;- \"Nuka_Pass\"\nseason &lt;- \"Late winter\"\nn_cold &lt;- sum(kefj_site == site &\n                kefj_season == season &\n                kefj_temperature &lt;= -4 &\n                kefj_exposure == \"air\")\nn_total &lt;- sum(kefj_site == site &\n                 kefj_season == season)\nhours_cold &lt;- n_cold * 30 / 60\ndays_total &lt;- n_total * 30 / 60 / 24\nhours_cold_per_day &lt;- hours_cold / days_total\nhours_cold_per_day\n\nP2 Let’s turn that code chunk into a function. What would you call that function? How many parameters should it take and what would you call them?\nP3 Write a function to encapsulate the code chunk above. Check that it contains all five parts of a function.\n\n\nMake an extreme choice\nThe code chunk above focuses on extreme cold exposure, but we would like to use a similar procedure for extreme heat exposure. In order, here’s what we’ll do.\n\nUse an if else statement to create a logical vector indicating whether temperatures are extreme.\nIncorporate the new logical vector into our old code chunk to make it more flexible.\nAdd a parameter to your function so it can handle extreme heat or cold.\n\nP4 Fill in the code below to create a logical vector indicating extreme temperatures.\n\nextreme_type &lt;- \"cold\"\nif (??? == \"???\") {\n  is_extreme &lt;- kefj_temperature ??? ???\n} ??? {\n  ???\n}\n\nP5 Copy-paste the code from P1 and edit it to incorporate the is_extreme vector into the extreme temperature exposure procedure.\nP6 Copy-paste the function you wrote in P3 and edit it to add a parameter that lets you switch between extreme heat and cold exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMake sure that when you edit the function you choose readable names for the function, its parameters, and any variables you define in the body!\n\n\n\n\nSeason to taste\nIn the previous section, you used if then to make choices. Now, you’re going to use for loops to repeat an operation over multiple inputs. In order, you’ll:\n\nIdentify the unique seasons to loop over\nCalculate extreme heat and cold exposure in each season (for a given site)\nAdd a nested loop to iterate over the unique sites, as well\n\nWhen you’re done, you’ll use the results of your loops to find the mildest season in Alaska.\nP7 What seasons are in the kefj dataset? What function would you use to identify them?\nP8 Fill in the blanks below to make a for loop that prints the extreme hot and cold exposure across seasons at site Aialik.\n\nseasons &lt;- ???\nfor (??? in ???) {\n  heat_exposure &lt;- ???(???, ???, \"hot\")\n  cold_exposure &lt;- ???\n  print(paste(\"Aialik\", ???, heat_exposure, cold_exposure))\n}\n\nP9 Copy-paste your answer to P8 and add a nested for loop to iterate across sites as well as seasons.\nP10 Examine your results from P9. You should find two outputs where both extreme heat and cold exposure were 0. What season were they in?"
